Model Evaluation with Cross-Validation and Random Forest

 1. Problem Statement

Evaluating machine learning models is essential to ensure their reliability and generalization capability. Cross-validation techniques, such as K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold, provide robust performance estimates by reducing overfitting and bias. This project focuses on evaluating multiple classification models using cross-validation and improving performance through an optimized Random Forest ensemble model.

 2. Objectives

* Apply K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation techniques.
* Train and evaluate Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest models.
* Optimize Random Forest hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
* Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

 3. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 303 instances with 13 input features and one target variable. The target variable represents the class label for the classification task. All features are numerical and suitable for supervised machine learning algorithms.

 4. Feature and Target Separation

Feature and target separation is a crucial step in machine learning. Input features, which are the independent variables, are used to train the model, while the target variable represents the outcome we aim to predict. Proper separation prevents data leakage and ensures that the model learns only from relevant information. Preprocessing steps such as scaling or encoding are applied only to the features, not the target. This maintains data integrity and ensures accurate learning. By clearly distinguishing inputs from outputs, the model can generalize better to unseen data. Overall, this step lays the foundation for building reliable and effective models.

 5. K-Fold Cross-Validation

K-Fold cross-validation is used to reliably assess model performance. The dataset is split into K equal folds, with each fold used once as a validation set and the remaining folds for training. This process repeats K times so every data point is used for both training and validation. Results from all folds are averaged to produce a robust estimate of the model’s accuracy. K-Fold cross-validation reduces the risk of overfitting and helps evaluate the model’s stability. It is particularly useful for small to medium datasets. By using this method, we gain confidence that the model will perform well on unseen data.

 6. Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation with SVM

Stratified K-Fold cross-validation was applied to evaluate the SVM model. This technique preserves the original class distribution in each fold, which is important for imbalanced datasets. Feature scaling was applied to improve SVM performance, as SVM is sensitive to the magnitude of input features. Each fold is used once for validation while the remaining folds are used for training. Validation results are averaged to provide a reliable estimate of overall performance. Stratified K-Fold ensures that each class is fairly represented in both training and validation. This approach guarantees that the SVM model generalizes well across all classes.

 7. Random Forest Model Evaluation

The Random Forest model was evaluated using Stratified K-Fold cross-validation to ensure balanced class distribution in each fold. Random Forest combines multiple decision trees, which reduces overfitting and improves prediction accuracy. Each tree was trained on random subsets of data and features, and performance metrics from all folds were averaged. This method provides a robust evaluation, demonstrating that Random Forest is both accurate and reliable for classification tasks.

 8. Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest model. Parameters such as the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples split were adjusted to improve performance.

 9. Final Model Evaluation Metrics

The optimized Random Forest model was evaluated using cross-validation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validated results were used instead of training accuracy to avoid overfitting.

 10. Model Comparison

A comparative analysis of all models was conducted to assess their performance. The tuned Random Forest model achieved the highest cross-validation accuracy, outperforming Decision Tree and SVM models. This highlights the advantage of ensemble methods over single models. Stratified K-Fold ensured balanced evaluation across all classes. Comparing models helps identify the best approach for deployment. Random Forest demonstrated consistent accuracy, stability, and robustness. It emerged as the most effective model for this dataset.

 11. Conclusion

This project demonstrated the importance of cross-validation in evaluating machine learning models. Stratified K-Fold ensured fair and balanced evaluation, particularly for imbalanced classes. Random Forest, combined with hyperparameter tuning, provided the highest accuracy and stability. Ensemble learning reduces overfitting and improves generalization. Cross-validation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score confirmed the model’s reliability. Overall, the optimized Random Forest model delivered the best performance. The study highlights careful evaluation and tuning as key steps in building robust predictive models.
