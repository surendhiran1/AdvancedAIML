1. Problem Statement

Evaluating machine learning models is essential to ensure their reliability and generalization capability.
Cross-validation techniques, such as K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold, provide robust performance estimates by reducing overfitting and bias.

This project focuses on:

* Evaluating multiple classification models using cross-validation.
* Improving performance through an optimized Random Forest ensemble model**.

2. Objectives

* Apply K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation techniques.
* Train and evaluate Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest models.
* Optimize Random Forest hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
* Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

* 303 instances** with 13 input features** and 1 target variable**.
* The target variable represents the class label for classification.
* All features are numerical, suitable for supervised machine learning algorithms.

---

4. Feature and Target Separation

Feature and target separation is crucial:

* Input features are independent variables used to train the model.
* Target variable is the outcome we aim to predict.
* Proper separation prevents data leakage and ensures the model learns only from relevant information.
* Preprocessing steps such as scaling or encoding are applied only to features, not the target.

> This step lays the foundation for building **reliable and effective models**.

 5. K-Fold Cross-Validation

* K-Fold splits the dataset into **K equal folds.
* Each fold is used once as a validation set, while the remaining folds are for training.
* The process repeats K times, and results are averaged.
* Reduces overfitting and evaluates model stability.

> Particularly useful for small to medium datasets.

---

6. Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation with SVM

* Stratified K-Fold preserves the **original class distribution** in each fold.
* Important for imbalanced datasets.
* **Feature scaling** improves SVM performance, as SVM is sensitive to input magnitude.
* Validation results are averaged to provide a reliable estimate of overall performance.

> Ensures the SVM model **generalizes well across all classes**.

---

7. Random Forest Model Evaluation

* Evaluated using Stratified K-Fold to maintain class balance.
* Random Forest combines multiple decision trees reducing overfitting.
* Each tree trains on random subsets of data and features.
* Metrics from all folds are averaged for a robust evaluation**.

> Demonstrates Random Forest is accurate and reliable for classification.

8. Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV

* GridSearchCV optimizes Random Forest hyperparameters.
* Tuned parameters include:

  * Number of trees (`n_estimators`)
  * Maximum depth of trees (`max_depth`)
  * Minimum samples required to split a node (`min_samples_split`)
* Improves model performance and accuracy.

---

9. Final Model Evaluation Metrics

* Optimized Random Forest evaluated using cross-validation metrics**:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-score
* Cross-validated results used instead of training accuracy to **avoid overfitting**.

---

10. Model Comparison

* Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest models were compared.
* The tuned Random Forest achieved the highest cross-validation accuracy.
* Stratified K-Fold ensured balanced evaluation across all classes.

> Random Forest demonstrated consistent accuracy, stability, and robustness, making it the most effective model for this dataset.

11. Conclusion

* Cross-validation is essential for evaluating model performance
* Stratified K-Fold ensures fair evaluation particularly for imbalanced datasets.
* Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning provides the highest accuracy and stability.
* Ensemble learning reduces overfitting and improves generalization.
* Cross-validation metrics precision, recall, F1-score confirm model reliability.

> Overall, the optimized Random Forest** delivers the best performance and demonstrates that careful evaluation and tuning are key to robust predictive models.
